# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The Result

I made this challenge using TaildwindCSS for the styles.
I installed the package using `npm` so if you want to check this code out, you will need to:

1. Run `npm install` to install the depencies
2. Run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/input.css -o ./src/styles/styles.css --watch` to build the css file the site is going to use
3. Use any pluging like `Live Server` to "run" the code and check the `index.html` file on the browser
